Using individual-level data (children) from the Demographic and Health Surveys (https://dhsprogram.com/Methodology/Survey-Types/DHS.cfm) conducted in over 70 low- and middle-income countries, this project calculates the disparities in child health and development outcomes between sub-population groups in each country. 
For instance, these groups are defined by household wealth (top 10% and bottom 40%), region (within a country), sex, urban/rural, ethnicity, etc.
